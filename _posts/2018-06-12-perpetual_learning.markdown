I feel like with all the stimulus of new technology and the access to information at any given moment has moved us into a new revolution of learning and understanding. Not needing to retain information as much has turned to reading less, as we now have the ability to look up anything at anytime. The average "Joe" now can answer any question, from the simpilist math equation to the most complex cooking recipe. 

Resources like youtube can teach you things that you used to only learn through work experience or higher education, now all available through a neutral network. Its an amazing time we live in. With everything in life, it comes at a cost. In my opinon,  that cost is the intelligence becoming stagnant. The lack of excersizing your mind or retaining information. I personally feel like I have seen the effects of being relient on technology while answering any questions, and in a way, had made me feel like I am nearly useless without it.

This is why I am studying software.

It is always going to change and I will have to continue to push my mind to stay relevant, and while there are resources that can help to basicly accomplish any task you need it to, there is always room for improvement. By writing code and learning new languages you are constantly at the forfront of the what the ceiling is that can be reached. I am learning the resources that we have available to us now in order to understand progression. To work in a way that pushes me to learn and requires an actual application of skill as well as knowledge.
