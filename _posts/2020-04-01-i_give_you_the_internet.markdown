Hyper Text Markup Language - it's one of the most (if not the most) viewed code of all time. Its constantly changing and updated to meet the demands of time, but has kept the same principle in the simplist form. Displaying Information to be shared by everyone. Like a universal language for coders, it promotes sharing and processing of Data which is how the world we know runs. 

I imagine the first caveman who discovered fire, and how exciting and new that must have felt. And then how he would then go to share and communicate to fellow cave-people and begin the steps to modernizing. Html is how we all get to receive the great information and data from the world.
